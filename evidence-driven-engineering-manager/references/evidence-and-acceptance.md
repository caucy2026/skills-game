# Evidence and Acceptance

## Evidence hierarchy

Use the strongest applicable evidence and label weaker evidence honestly:

1. final product used through the real user path;
2. target-environment or paired client/server runtime evidence;
3. protocol, persistence, replay, and restart evidence;
4. integration tests across real production code paths;
5. focused component tests;
6. successful build or static analysis;
7. code inspection or member claim.

Lower levels can prove intermediate work but cannot replace a required higher-level acceptance. Separate collection, static inference, component pass, protocol pass, final-product behavior, and overall completion.

## Acceptance record

Each acceptance candidate needs:

- requirement and exact scope;
- preconditions and artifact identity;
- expected result and measured actual result;
- executable steps or command;
- pass/fail/not-comparable/component-only/blocked verdict;
- logs, reports, screenshots, video, database state, protocol traces, hashes, or commit IDs;
- regression scope and result;
- unverified items and why they remain open.

A passing command without a checked result is not evidence. A generated file without provenance is not evidence. A screenshot proves only the visible frame unless runtime state and sequence are independently established.

## Hourly acceptance ledger

Every active member reports once per 60 minutes, then immediately continues working. If a necessary long command crosses the boundary, report the current phase, live evidence, and justified remaining estimate; do not wait for the command to finish before accounting for the hour.

Required fields:

- reporting window and end-state requirement;
- planned deliverables, actual completions, acceptance candidates, passes, failures, not-comparable cases, component-only cases, and blockers—each with counts and denominators;
- changed files and commits;
- commands/tests with passed/total and named failures;
- one vertical record per acceptance candidate: ID, scenario, scope, criterion, expected, actual, verdict, evidence path, SHA-256;
- relevant end-to-end data flow and state transitions;
- reference media and final-artifact evidence when visual work is involved;
- generalization evidence and special-case scan when a reusable algorithm is required;
- newly excluded hypotheses and supporting evidence;
- same-route attempt count;
- one primary goal and one safe fallback for the next hour, each with acceptance criteria.

If zero items are acceptable, report `0/N` and the concrete evidence or hypotheses produced. Do not substitute “working,” “nearly done,” or a subjective percentage.

## Independent manager review

Do not accept the member's ledger at face value. Sample its commands, open its artifacts, inspect the cited images, check hashes when important, and compare the claim with the project contract. Mark unverifiable member statements as claims, not facts.

When a status summary conflicts with raw logs, files, builds, or running commands, prefer timestamped raw evidence. When evidence remains ambiguous, use `pending verification`; do not infer inactivity or issue an extreme low score.

## 100-point scoring

Use [scoring-and-reporting.md](scoring-and-reporting.md) as the single scoring authority. It defines weights, uncertainty handling, responsibility, reminder thresholds, and the mandatory report gate. Do not maintain a second scoring system in a project checkpoint or award historical work as current-window output.

## Facts and judgments

Every report distinguishes:

- confirmed facts;
- member statements not independently checked;
- manager judgments based on listed facts;
- unknowns that cannot support a negative inference.

If the manager made a wrong call, retract it promptly, show the corrected evidence and score, explain the cause and impact, and add a concrete prevention rule.
